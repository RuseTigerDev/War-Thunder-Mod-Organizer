# War-Thunder-Mod-Organizer
This, as the name suggests, is a Mod Organizer for War Thunder. Please Enjoy.

Note that the dist version is too large to post on github ~500mb though I do hope it's possible to trim it down, for the time being I can only post the .exe and the .py alongside the art assests.

Probably for the best, that will prevent anyone from trying to run it on their system who doesn't know how to get Visual Studio going so that will keep users away for now while testing and critics go through.
