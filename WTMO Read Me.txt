Hello everyone!

This is the War Thunder Mod Organizer, an example variant of the Universal Mod Organizer project.

Special thanks to the Reddit python and GTG Discord team. This would not have been possible without your help!

- Note this is an unfinished test version of the mod organizer -
- Current version needs proof reading and major critics as well
- as a revised Mod list import export system and revised image 
- call for main logo and possible splash image.

Thank you for downloading and have fun!
